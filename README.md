# Federalist Papers

The Federalist Papers are 85 political essays, originally printed under a pseudonym, Publius, in 1788. Since then the authors have been found to be Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. However, some of the papers are of disputed authorship. In order to predict the authors of these papers, we will performed feature selection and ran the algorithms: k-Means, k-NN, and Na√Øve Bayes to estimate the authorship of these disputed papers.
